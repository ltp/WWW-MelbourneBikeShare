=head1 NAME

WWW::MelbourneBikeShare - Simple interface to the Melbourne Bike Share open
data set.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides a simple interface to the Melbourne Bike Share open data 
set (L<https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/Melbourne-bike-share/tdvh-n9dv>).

The Melbourne Bike Share open data set provides up to date information on the 
number of available bikes and slots available at each Melbourne Bike Share
terminal.  The data set also provides terminal metadata including; the terminal 
friendly name, the terminal ID, the terminal geographical co-ordinates, and a
time stamp indicating the time at which the terminal data was last updated.

	use WWW::MelbourneBikeShare;

	my $mbs = WWW::MelbourneBikeShare->new;

	# Get a list of all Melbourne Bike Share terminals as an array of
	# WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal objects.

	my @terminals = $mbs->terminals;

	# Print the ID, name, and number of bikes available at each terminal.
	
	map { 
		printf( "%-3s %-65 %-4s\n", $_->id, $_->name, $_->bikes )
	} @terminals;

	# Do the same thing, but order the list by the number of available bikes.
	map {
		printf( "%-3s %-65 %-4s\n", $_->id, $_->name, $_->bikes 
	} $mbs->by_available_bikes;

	# Or, by proximity to our current location.
	map { 
		printf( "%-3s %-65 %-4s\n", $_->id, $_->name, $_->bikes 
	} $mbs->by_distance( -37.816181, 144.952688 );

	# Get our closest terminal.
	$mbs->nearest( -37.816181, 144.952688 );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new ( cache => $CACHE_TIME )

Constructor method - creates a new WWW::MelbourneBikeShare object.  

Accepts one optional parameter: B<cache> which allows the caller to specify the
maximum cache time for retrieved data.

The data set is currently updated every fifteen minutes and typically within a
short period following the quarter hour interval (e.g. 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45).
If no cache parameter is supplied to the constructor, then a maximum cache 
duration of 900s will be used - this reduces the volume of requests required to
be made to the data provider.

Under most circumstances, it should not be necessary to provide a cache 
argument to the constructor as the default value should be sufficient.  If you
explicitly want to refresh the cache (e.g. you are using a local time source to
determine the update interval) then you may explicitly invalidate the cache by
callling the L</refresh> method.

=head2 refresh

Explicitly invalidate the local cache and cause the data set to be retrieved 
from the data provider.

=head1 terminals

Get a list of all Melbourne bike share terminals as an array of 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> objects.  The order of the terminals is
the same as is returned in the data set by the provider.

=head1 by_id 

Get a list of all Melbourne bike share terminals as an array of 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> objects ordered by id. Note that the B<id>
is different to the terminal id value returned by the B<terminal> method.

=head1 by_terminal

Get a list of all Melbourne bike share terminals as an array of 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> objects ordered by terminal id.

=head1 by_available_bikes 

Get a list of all Melbourne bike share terminals as an array of 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> objects ordered by the number of available
bikes.

=head1 by_available_docks 

Get a list of all Melbourne bike share terminals as an array of 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> objects ordered by the number of available
bike docks.

=head1 by_distance ( $LAT, $LON )

Get a list of all Melbourne bike share terminals as an array of 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> objects ordered by distance from the 
provided geographical co-ordinates.

=head1 id ( $ID )

Return the terminal with the given ID as a L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal>
object.

=head1 terminal

Return the terminal with the given terminal ID as a 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> object.

=head1 closest  ( $LAT, $LON )
Return the geographically nearest terminal as a 
L<WWW::MelbourneBikeShare::Terminal> object via distance from the provided
geographical co-ordinates.
